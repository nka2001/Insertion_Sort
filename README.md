# Insertion_Sort
This repo will hold an insertion sort algorithm. very basic, no GUI, written in a Java Console Application, the purpose is to create my own insertion sort.

I will be making insertion sort work on primitive, as well as reference types. 

Input: Numbers entered from the user into an array.
Output: Sorted array using the insertion sort algorithm.
